# PlannedTurnOff
A simple Python code that I have transfered from C++ with nothing too elaborate that only works with the sole purpose of setting a timer for your Computer to turn off.
-This one version is a simple installer.
-If you are new to python, then well, all you have to do is open "dist" once you install the program in the place you designated and go for the executable.
